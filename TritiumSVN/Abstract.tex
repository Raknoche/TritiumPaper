We present measurements of the electron-recoil (ER) response of the LUX dark matter detector using an internal tritium calibration source. The large-statistics tritium dataset provides ideal single-beta events with high purity and good spatial uniformity. We report on the charge and light yields of liquid xenon at 180 V/cm and 105 V/cm with high accuracy down to 1.3~keV, investigate the width of the ER band, measure the energy threshold of the detector, and validate the combined energy model. These results provide input to the LUX Run3 WIMP search \cite{lux-reanalysis}.
