We present the measurement of the electron recoil (ER) band of the LUX dark matter detector using an internal tritium calibration source. Tritium provides an ideal single-beta source for characterizing the ER response of the detector with large statistics, high event purity, and spatial uniformity. We also report measurements of the fundamental properties of liquid xenon as a particle detection medium at 180 V/cm and 100 V/cm.
