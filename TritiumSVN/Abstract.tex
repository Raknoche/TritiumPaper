We have developed a new method to inject tritiated methane into detectors which utilize liquid and gas phase noble gases as an internal calibration source.  The ability to use internal calibration sources is critical in large scale particle physics experiments.  Our system uses volume sharing techniques to inject a finely tuned amount of tritiated methane into the detector, and uses a zirconium getter to remove the tritiated methane after the calibration has been completed.  We present data from the LUX detector to prove our tritiated methane system can calibrate electron recoil events and remove the internal source to undetectable levels afterward.
