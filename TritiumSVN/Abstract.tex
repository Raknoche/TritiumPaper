We present measurements of the electron-recoil (ER) response of the LUX dark matter detector using an internal tritium calibration source. The large-statistics tritium dataset provides ideal single-beta events with high purity and good spatial uniformity. We report on the charge and light yields of liquid xenon at 180 V/cm and 100 V/cm, investigate fluctuations in the ER band, and measure the energy threshold of the detector. These results provide input to the recent re-analysis of LUX Run3 science data.
