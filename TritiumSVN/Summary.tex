\section{Summary}

We have characterized the electron recoil response of the LUX dark matter experiment with a tritium calibration source. The large dataset, high event purity, and the simple nature of the decay provide a powerful tool to study the detector and to investigate the fundamental properties of LXe as a particle detection medium for WIMP searches. The results presented here are used in an improved analysis of the Run 3 WIMP search data in Ref. \cite{lux-reanalysis}.
