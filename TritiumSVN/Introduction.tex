\section{Introduction}

LUX is a WIMP search experiment located at the 4850' level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. LUX detects particle interactions in liquid xenon (LXe) via scintillation (S1) and charge (S2) signals. The LXe in LUX is instrumented as a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC), providing energy and position information in three dimensions. Electron-recoil (ER) and nuclear-recoil (NR) events are distinguished by the ratio of the charge and light signals (S2/S1). Results from the first LUX science run (Run 3) were first reported in Ref. \cite{lux-prl}. An improved analysis of the Run 3 data is reported in Ref. \cite{lux-reanalysis}.

%In the WIMP region of interest ($\sim$1 - 8 \keVee), LUX rejects external gamma backgrounds primarily through self-shielding, achieving an event rate of \fixit{3.6 mDRU\footnote{One mDRU is $10^{-3}$ events/\keVee/kg/day} between 0.9 and 5.3 \keVee in the 118 kg fiducial volume}.  The LUX TPC reconstructs the three coordinates of the event vertex with a spatial precision of about 1~cm,  allowing events near the edge of the detector to be rejected. 

LUX is monitored and calibrated primarily with beta sources that can be dissolved in the LXe. 
%External gamma sources, such as \cssrc or \thsrc, are unable to produce a useful rate of fiducial single-scatter calibration events in the WIMP region of interest ($\sim$1 - 8 \keVee) due to self-shielding. This effect is substantial in LUX because of the large active mass (270 kg) and favorable aspect ratio (50 cm diameter and 60 cm height). 
Two such sources,  \krsrc\cite{Kastens:2009rt, Baudis} and tritium ($^{3}$H), have been deployed in LUX, both providing a large sample of spatially uniform events. \krsrc is a source of 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV internal conversion  (IC) electrons and is well suited for monitoring and correcting the spatial and time variations of the S1 and S2 signals. \krsrc is unable, however, to characterize the S2/S1 electron-recoil discriminant variable, or to probe the detector threshold, because both IC electrons are above the dark matter energy range, and because the S2 signals from the two electrons generally overlap in the detector.

In this article we report results from the calibration of LUX with tritium, a single-beta emitter with a Q value of 18.6 keV\cite{Tritium_Q}. Its mean decay energy is 5.6 keV, with a broad peak at 2.5 keV, and 75\% of its decays are below 8 keV\cite{Tritium_Mean,Tritium_Eq}. These characteristics make it an ideal source for studying the ER response of LUX in the dark matter energy range ($\sim$1-8 keV (electron equivalent)). 

Tritium must be removed from the detector by purification due to its long half-life (12.3 years\cite{Tritium_halflife_all}). We use tritiated methane (CH$_3$T) as the host molecule to deliver tritium activity into LUX. Compared to molecular tritium (T$_2$), CH$_3$T has several advantages. It does not adsorb onto surfaces like the T$_2$ molecule, and it does not interfere with charge transport in LXe. Also, diffusion of tritium activity into plastic detector components is an important concern, since that activity may later re-contaminate the LXe during the WIMP search runs.  This risk is mitigated by CH$_3$T due to its larger molecular size and lower diffusion constant and solubility. We investigated the contamination risk experimentally with a series of bench-top tests prior to the first injection into LUX. These tests, which are described in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix1}, demonstrated that the injection and removal could be done without undue risk to the experiment. 

An initial tritium dataset of $\sim$ 7,000 fiducial events was obtained by LUX in August of 2013, and the results were reported in Ref. \cite{lux-prl}. Subsequently, in December 2013, we injected additional activity with a higher rate and obtained a fiducial tritium dataset of over 180,000 events. This dataset is used to calibrate the LUX ER band in Ref. \cite{lux-reanalysis} in-situ removing systematics from relying on simulations and interpolation of data from other detectors. Except where otherwise noted, in this article we report results from the larger December 2013 dataset.
